# Fluid Simulation
This repo is based off of [Mike Ash's work](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html).
My goal is to understand the rudimentary principles of fluid simulation. The end goal is to add objects into the fluid to simulate restricted flow, flow around objects, etc.
